summer twenty-one  
my dog vomits a chorus of cicadas,  
each lifecycles older than him.  
_hack-hack-hack-hack_

in the spare room  
cancer steals my mother’s sixties;  
chemo takes her appetite.  
_hack-hack-hack-hack_

summer sixty-one  
i’d die happy to see halley’s comet  
just once. i won’t push my luck.  

but i’d trade all my red jokers  
and my double trump aces  
for the best kind of luck to have—  

the privilege  
to escape the beast’s maw  
to out-age your mother  
to have the chance  
to grow old.  

we’re racing for the end.  
but nobody knows  
death never puts points  
in the bottom.
