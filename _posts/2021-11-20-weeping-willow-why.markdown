why do you  
reach for the ground?  

what do you see  
that the great maple  
and steadfast oak  
have missed?

were the harps  
too heavy in babylon?  
who, with your head  
bowed, are you praying for?

those long spindly fingers  
and curling joints  
as if an offering  
for smaller hands below.
