78 years and a week between the  
trinity test and my heart, detonating  
for you. two nuclear reactions of world-  
changing proportions.  

july monsoons wash the clouds  
orange and pink like the nights  
in los alamos. lightning splits  
the sky like man split the atom.  
your eyes scoop up when you smile  
upside down in the bed.  

i like that i smile so much around you.  
how well my head fits in the soft crook  
of your neck. how you talk to strangers  
just to talk, but when you talk to me,  
you listen.
