i used to picture my parents in old age  
bickering about dinner, watching  
chinese historical soaps and home  
renovation shows, walking hand in hand  
in silence like the elderly couples  
circling the park on valentine's day.  

last year, my mother aged thirty years  
in one summer. now she waits for my  
father. i wonder when babies go to  
heaven, do they get to grow up?  

when judgment day comes i want to  
see my mother and my father  
with crows feet and marionette smiles  
and fingers trembling, interlaced,  
with spider-silk veins, two souls  
together again in glorified bodies.
