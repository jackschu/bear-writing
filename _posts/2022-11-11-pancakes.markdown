on my mother's fifty-fifth, i woke up late,  
and said a prayer on my unmade bed.  

then i called her on the phone  
and said, happy birthday! you can get  
the senior night discount at ihop now.  

she told me she had never been,  
so i told her all about the pancakes.  
blueberry and chocolate chip and lemon ricotta.  

oh, i can't have that, my mother said.  
her voice was thin and there was a little static crackle   
like she was calling from an elevator, or a rain cloud.  

why not? i asked. it's your birthday!  
don't tell me you're worried about your blood sugar again.  
and i heard her laugh.  

but really she and i both knew why.  
Jesus would have been a waffle guy,  
so there are no pancakes in heaven.
