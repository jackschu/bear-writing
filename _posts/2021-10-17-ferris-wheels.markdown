in my dreams  
my mother is round  
and pink-cheeked. i remember  
crows-feet smile-line testimonials  
to laughter. creasing, again—then the  
carriage jostles, hinges creak, the axle turns.  
and she is dying of something i don’t yet know.  
                      
but for now  
she is here  
and we  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down  

on the pier  
the boy i thought i  
maybe could love says sorry  
with his surprise; his contrite velvet  
eyes. i say i am going to write about you.  
the protagonist of my world asks, do you still  
want to ride the ferris wheel—will i be the villain?  

(now, the doctors say,  
my nightmare has a name.  
i think i hate when i don’t know  
but later on i always miss it.)  

before  
everything ends  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             up  
let’s go
