have you ever been to virginia?  
go sometime. go in the summer.  
go when the air is thick like a sauna.  
when the grass grows tall and sweet,  
after a storm to hear the bullfrogs cry.  
stay for a while. not too long.  

i last came by when my hair was long.  
it seems to grow faster in virginia,  
even while time slows down. i cry  
the same and miss like last summer.  
as blueberries. some sour, some sweet.  
cool down in the heat. visit a sauna.  

my favorite pool used to have a sauna.  
they tore it down. good-bye, so long  
maybe hte popsicles were too sweet  
and you'd get sticky feet. in virginia  
you want clean toes in the summer.  
gnats fly low. they can't hear you cry.  

it storms at night. my dog used to cry  
and hide in the shower like a sauna.  
he's a may baby, unused to summer.  
we never have as much time as we long  
not even in slow swampy virginia.  
hellos are just goodbyes in bittersweet.  

don't let me fool you. it ages sweet.  
can't wait to get away, then away i cry  
how good i used to have it, in virginia.  
even with the air thick like a sauna.  
thing is, no such thing as too long,  
i'll miss you every summer.  

every year grows new in the summer.  
before leaves brown & sap gets sweet.  
the days die before they go long.  
birds put in overtime to cry;  
the pool gets new tiles for a sauna.  
things change up close. even in virginia.  

mom, i wish you could see this summer.  
i saved some peonies, pink and sweet.  
come visit us soon. not too long.
