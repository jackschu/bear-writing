Scott Street sees the hottest August in two centuries after Henry’s fifth grade graduation. He’s miserable. Normally he doesn’t mind the balmy heat of summer, glad of empty, homework-free days that melt into each other and *drip, drip, drip* by syrupy-slow. But this one seems to stretch especially slowly, and the promise of rejoining his older sister and their friends in junior high has him impatient for autumn.

In the meantime, though, they have to find respite where they can.

It turns out that finding a local hangout that is both vigorously air conditioned and welcoming of four teenagers who produce no money and copious amounts of body heat is a Sisyphean task. It’s a daily challenge. The four of them—Hazel and Henry, Lee, Almond—coalesce every morning in Hazel and Henry’s front yard to discuss leads before the unrelenting sun summits the sky.

“I think the church just got a new Dyson,” Hazel offers. As wretched as he feels, Henry figures he takes the heat better than she does. Her pink, pinched face is shiny with sweat, the brown baby hairs at her temple curly and slick from moisture. She barely wrinkles her nose when Henry places another plucked blade of grass on her knee.

“’M not allowed in there,” Almond says, “My moms won’t let me.”

Henry crushes another blade of grass between his fingers, watching the green spread across the tips of his fingers before wiping them off against the lines of Hazel’s Bermuda shorts tan. Like she wants to kick him in the face, Hazel’s knee jerks, but only briefly.

“I’m sure they’d rather you cool your head and *maybe* commit heresy than suffer out here and *definitely* get heat stroke.” Hazel says.

“S’fine if you just sit there,” Lee adds. “Just don’t, like, convert. How hard can it be.”

“What about the rug store again?” Almond deflects.

Henry shakes his head.

“We broke Joanne’s window just last week,” Hazel points out.

“Yeah, dumbass,” Lee says, earning a half-hearted elbow to the ribcage. She snickers and rolls over onto her side, daring to retreat to the shade of a second tree. “How ‘bout the fish aisle? Not at the butcher, at the, the,”

“At the Korean grocer?” Hazel asks.

“Dora Kim works Thursdays,” Almond says, “And she’s still mad about the tires, I think.”

“People around here sure know how to hold a grudge,” Hazel mutters.

Almond throws one arm across his eyes. As if enhanced through a heat haze, his messy, wavy hair dapples in shades of chestnut and tan from the bits of sunlight that poke through the leaves. “The library’s nice if ya go into the basement.”

“Henry’s got too many overdue library books,” Hazel says.

Henry scratches his cheek. He’s going to return them, swear. Once he scrounges up enough quarters to pay for the late fees.

“S’been five min,” Lee shakes her wristwatch, wrist included, in Hazel’s face.

Begrudgingly, Hazel leans forward and hands over the little hand-crank fan they pass around in circles on hot days. A joint purchase; communally shared. Lee snatches it swiftly before scooting back into the shade.

“Hey,” Almond interjects, “It’s my turn.”

“Nope.” Lee begins to crank. The pocket-sized fan whirrs into motion, blowing dark, choppy strands away from her face. Henry watches enviously.

“Yeah it is. I’m after Hazel,”

“Henry gave me his turn,” Hazel reminds him.

Defeated, Almond *hmphs* in his throat and sits back. “Whatever.”

Hazel rolls her eyes. She tells him, “Don’t be a baby, Al.”

“Whatever,” Almond says again. “What about the Radioshack?”

“Are you nutty? It gets t’ like a hundred degrees in there,” Lee says. “All the TVs an’ shit goin’ off at once,” 

Henry snickers. *Nutty*.

“Do ya have any better ideas?” Almond shoots back.

Lee doesn’t. And apparently nobody else does, either, because they all quiet until only the sounds of rustling branches and summer cicadas are audible. This impasse, he figures, is a natural consequence of summer slipping by. Each day it gets harder and harder to find a place in town that hadn’t seen them before, much less one that would be happy seeing them again.

It’s counterproductive. Spending time with his friends always makes Henry feel warm inside, except he’s already feeling warm all over on the outside, so he just lays under the looming Bigleaf Maple and ignores the dry scratchy-rough feeling of grass on the backs of his calves and tries to move as little as possible. The cool dirt welcomes him. Sunspots dance bright in the corners of his vision. Above, Henry traces the stem and the veins and the crinkle-cut edges of a leaf on the lowest branch and thinks of how it might feel in his fingers, smooth on one side, spindly and rayed on the other.

Lee hands Hazel the fan next. It whirrs quietly, the sound settling light against eardrums.

“You know,” Lee starts, and clears her voice a few more times before they all turn to look at her. *Hurk. Harrghh.* It doesn’t make a difference. Her voice stays scratchy. “My cousin says, Gen’ral Reuby brews moonshine an’ stuff in the back.”

“Moonshine?” Henry leans in.

“No way,” Almond says. “That’s illegal!”

“Don’t think Reuby cares ‘bout that,” Hazel says, eyes bright. “What else did your cousin say?”

Lee shrugs. “He just got barrels on barrels stacked up in the storeroom, s’what he said. He was there helpin’ move furniture. Said Reuby let ‘im have a taste. *Real* strong.”

“My brother works there,” Almond protests, “He would’ve seen.”

“He hides it,” Lee says, “If you weren’t lookin’, no way you’d know.”

Henry clicks his tongue. “Waste.”

Hazel agrees. “I bet that bastard drinks it all himself. We’d put it to better use.”

And when Henry rolls over to peer at her face, the expression there is equal parts familiar and terrifying, like reading the sixth or seventh installment of one of his mystery novel series and feeling a recognizable kind of twist creeping up through the pages.

“In fact,” she continues, “We might even be doing him a favor, taking a few bottles off his hands. People get paid for quality assurance, and we’re practically doing it for free. Make sure it’s brewed right, won’t kill anyone, you know?”

“No money,” Henry says.

“If he wanted money, he’d be selling it, yeah?”

“Yeah.” Lee says with a sharp nod.

“Drinking warms ya up,” Almond points out, quite reasonably. “And I don’t know ‘bout you, but I’m already sweating out here.”

“Right,” Hazel says, “So after the buzz wears off we’ll feel cooler in comparison. It’s like when you’re outside for a while in winter freezing your ass off, but when you get back inside suddenly you’re too warm for your boots.”

They mull this over. It makes sense.

“So—what, we just go in and steal a few bottles?” Almond furrows his brow.

Henry frowns. “Borrow.”

“Yeah,” Hazel agrees, “Once we get a taste we can make more and replace what we took. Can’t be that hard, right? Doesn’t your brother have a shift today?”

“Well, ya, he does,” Almond says, “but I don’t wanna bug him.”

“Come on,” Hazel goads, “He doesn’t have to do much. Just give us an in.”

Almond groans. He turns to Lee.

“Does he got the kind that tastes like cider? The ones that make you go,” he mimes something indecipherable with his hands.

“Sure,” Lee says, “Got all kinds.”

“Awesome,” Hazel says, a little too gleefully. “So it’s settled, then.”

“Fine. Whatever. If we get caught I’m ratting all of ya out instantly.” Almond says.

Lee snickers. “No you won’t.”

He frowns. “I would.”

“You won’t. ‘Cause you got no other friends.”

“Ouch,” Henry says, meaning to be funny, but instead Almond just sends him a flushed glare. Though, Lee scrunches up her nose and her crooked right canine pokes out like she’s paying more attention to keeping her snigger in than how her teeth look, so he counts it as a success.

Henry basks in the little victory for a moment, leaning back on his palms and listening to Hazel and Almond and Lee caucus about possible plans and escape routes. A breeze picks up. It catches the branches of the maple tree and pulls them along, then releases, the boughs and leaves strung along and snapping back into place. *Catch, release. Catch, release*.

The wooden floor planks of General Reuben’s Goods ‘n’ Supply Co. are as creaky as ever when Henry and Lee step inside. The brass bell that hangs above the entryway chimes brightly, announcing their presence. Though not the most orderly, among its crowded aisles and plastic endcaps can be found any combination of packaged chips and candies, hats, sunglasses, umbrellas, fishing equipment, batteries, radio parts, phone chargers, bicycle locks, cigars and cigarettes, woollen socks, and anything else one might need to get through the day. In the winter you can get discount cookie tins and peppermints and hot chocolate. In the summer you can get cotton candy and iced slushies and—Henry’s favorite—Spongebob-shaped ice cream bars with the gooey-melty yellow pores and sad drippy eyes.

From his usual haunt next to the register and behind the locked-up glass of Marlboros and Camels and Kents, General Reuben spares them only a half-second glance before returning his attention to the daily paper. “You break it, you pay fer it.”

“You got it,” Lee says, and disappears into the snack aisle.

“Hi, Mister Reuby,” Henry says. He’s still unsure of the veracity of the man’s claim to veterancy, and mister is always a safe bet.

Reuben grunts. His walrus-styled moustache, fluffy and unkempt like a mop dog, trembles when he thinks. “Eight letter word, egg.”

Henry thinks. “Omelette?”

He shakes his head. “Starts with an S.”

“… Scramble?”

“Ah, that’s it. Thanks, boy.” Reuben looks up and offers him a single, grave nod. Henry’s chest swells with pride. “Where’s that devil sister of yours?”

“Outside,” Henry says, and glances to the window. He just barely catches a glimpse of Almond holding up a highlighter green tennis racket and Hazel directing his positioning.

Lee brings a bag of Lays Flamin’ Hot potato chips to the counter and produces a few crumpled dollar bills. She only buys them because nobody else can handle the spice. As Reuben checks her out, Almond’s older brother emerges from the back storeroom and starts to fire up the hot dog roller.

“Hey, Henry. Lee.” he says when he notices them.

“Hi, Walnut,” Henry says. He sidles up to the counter and watches the beef franks roast and redden and turn endlessly, the heat from the machine making him feel a bit funny. He tries to picture life as a hot dog, being rolled around and around until he’s browned on all sides. Warm and toasty.  

Walnut looks from him to Reuben, and one of his light eyes twitches half-open to shut. Henry stares back.

“Um,” he says, “Is there something in your eye?”

“What? No,” Walnut says, “I’m just saying, I got ya. Ya feel me?”

“Oh,” Henry says. “I feel you.”

When he steps away from the hot dog machine, the rest of the small, stuffy store does indeed feel cooler in comparison. His fingers twitch. He wishes had money for an ice cream, or a phone to text Hazel and ask for an ice cream. 

Thankfully, the plan doesn’t rely on Henry having either of those things, which is good because he doesn’t. Outside come the telltale sounds of something delicate shattering, and Almond’s high-pitched scream. A car alarm goes off. *Wee-woo, wee-woo.* Hazel yells something that sounds a bit like *quiet!* or *shut your face!* or *we’re going to get in trouble!* but it comes out muffled.

“Oh, for the love of,” Reuben says, and picks up his feet and hauls it outside at a shockingly agile speed. Maybe he had actually done those tours in Vietnam.

“The hell was that?” Walnut asks from behind the counter.

“Mom’s favorite teapot,” Henry says mournfully.

“Huh,” Walnut says, and opens the door that separates the storefront from the back. “All right, be quick now, ya?”

“Roger,” Lee salutes, and disappears through the doorway. Henry has no choice but to follow.

Henry isn’t sure what he’s expecting, but he thinks it probably isn’t a short, dimly-lit hallway and a single doorway at the end. Maybe he’s thinking something twisty and winding and confusing. Instead, the door is unlocked and slides open easily, and inside is a tight storage room with shelves on shelves of unlabelled cardboard boxes, plastic containers, and wooden crates. No conspicuous wooden barrels in sight. A lone yellow bulb flickers and buzzes overhead.

“Must’ve hid ‘em after my cousin was here,” Lee says. “Now if I was a barrel of illegal spirits, where would I be?”

Henry doesn’t have an answer. He pokes and prods around but only succeeds in dislodging an attic’s worth of gray dust until he’s hacking it up into his elbow. Lee shushes him and points at a high shelf.

“There,” she says, “Swear I saw somethin’ liquid,”

They should’ve got Almond to do this part, Henry thinks a bit sourly. Almond’s the tallest by far. He has to find a foothold on a low shelf, the metal slippery against the soles of his tennis shoes, and push himself up by the palms. Then it’s a sort of awkward affair where he fights friction to slide the box full of plastic jugs to the edge, ignoring the sloshing sounds when it bumps into other containers on the way.

“Careful,” Lee hisses.

Henry takes a look inside and shakes his head. “Apple juice.”

Lee grits her teeth.

“I got th’ other row,” she says, and leaves him with this one.

If there’s an order to the mishmash-hodgepodge of inventory, Henry can’t figure it out. He works his way down the aisle and checks inside boxes as he goes, each of varying sizes and volumes, but finds no alcohol. He does, however, find beanie babies, baseball caps, clay pots, reading glasses, and a party-sized pack of individually-wrapped sour candies. He pockets a few, then hesitates and puts all but one back. They’re Hazel’s favorite.

When he hops down from the shelf, his knee snags on something on the bottom row and a small box of knick-knacks comes crashing down and in on itself.

“Shit,” Henry mutters, and pushes the whole mess underneath the metal shelves with the inside of his foot.

“Don’t break nothin’,” Lee calls.

“”M not,” Henry says, “Find anything?”

“Find what?” Reuben says, from the doorway.

There’s a muffled curse from Lee’s aisle and a *thud* as she lands on her feet. Henry blinks. He sidles into view, too. General Reuben suddenly looks about seven feet tall and perhaps just as wide, and Henry can picture him easily in the green-and-brown of a foot soldier’s uniform. Behind him stand Hazel and Almond, both staring sheepishly at their feet.

*Sorry*, Hazel mouths.

“Anyone care t’ explain,” he barks, “What exactly you four are looking for?”

Lee and Almond look at Hazel. Hazel looks at Henry. Henry looks at the ceiling and feels the lightbulb’s fluorescent yellow glow burn into his retinas.

“Moonshine?” he says, weakly.

“Get the hell out,” Reuben says. “Don’ make me say it twice.”

---

As an apology, Hazel buys him an ice cream. Henry’s not sure who she’s apologizing to—him or General Reuben. His moustache quivers a little and looks a bit happier when she hands over the quarters, though, and Walnut shrugs at them behind the counter as if to say *hey, no hard feelings, ya tried*.

Plus, the heat of embarrassment does make the sunset breeze feel cooler on his cheeks, so Henry figures it’s not all bad. As soon as they’re ushered out of the shop, Almond, who’s sporting a fresh set of band-aids on his knee, plops onto the dusty curb. Lee joins him, cross-legged, and opens her bag of chips.

“Can ya get that away from me,” Almond says, wrinkling his nose.

“No.” Lee says, and waves the open container in his face, spicy dust puffing up into the air and tickling the back of Henry’s throat.

Henry sticks his tongue out, but before he can lick a stripe up the side of his ice cream, the entire thing, simmering from the heat, detaches itself from the wooden stick and falls to the ground with a wet, quiet squelch. He watches Spongebob seep into the asphalt, dark pupils liquefying and mixing with artificial red and yellow and white.

“I’m not buying you a new one,” Hazel says.

Face turning to watch the strip of storefronts along the street close up for the evening, Henry sighs and takes his place on the grass next to Hazel. A few doors down, Dora Kim’s keys jangle as she stops to chatter with Pastor Garcia, who bends at the knees to water the plants on the church’s front stoop. Lean alley cats slink their way through wire fences. With a quiet clatter, Joanne McLean flips the sign in the front window of Joanne’s Rugs and Fabrics from *OPEN* to *CLOSED*. Even the ever-present rumble and hum of TVs and radios from the Radioshack begins to die down. Scott Street is never busy during any season, but even so, in the summer evenings it winds down like the rest of the louder world does.   

“Well,” Hazel breaks the silence. “What now?”

Henry tilts his head and blinks up at her.

“Tennis?” he asks, hopefully.

“Absolutely not,” she says.

He turns his head and appeals his case with a silent plea. Lee shakes her head but at least looks sorry. Almond shrugs.

“I’ll play,” he says.

“You only like playing with Henry ‘cause he lets you win.” Hazel grumbles.

“Shut ya mouth.” Almond scowls, but the damage is done. Henry frowns at the sunset and lets the light blind him briefly. When he closes his eyes a moment later, the insides of his eyelids burn in a riot of reds and oranges.

“Maybe tomorrow,” Hazel says, and it sounds like a promise.

The summer bullfrogs are out in full chorus today. A cooling inland breeze picks up, rustling the median’s tall, uncut grass. Henry holds out the leftover wooden stick of his ice cream and watches the sticky excess *drip, drip, drip* into the sidewalk. He thinks about catching tadpoles by the creek, or fireflies in jars. Not for long, and not to keep them. Just to see if he can. Then he’ll let them go. *Catch, release.*
