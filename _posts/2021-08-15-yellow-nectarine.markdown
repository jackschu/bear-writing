sorry  
that i missed you  
when you were at your best  

how sweet  
the syrup would have been  
how pink  
how taut your skin  

i was just so excited  
to see you again  
in the supermarket bins  
i scooped up one too many  
my lovely yellow nectarine  

now under my fingers  
you are leathery and loose  
and as i bite  
my mind fills in  
what could have beenâ€”  

still pretty good.
