make sure to show up for  
your appointment with a clean head,  
turned upside-down, inside-out,  
empty, no lice.  

be patient. the lice will be installed  
in phantasmagoria--  
little itty bitty black specks  
that lay eggs and marinate.  

like a clydesdale pulling his iron  
hayturner: a head lice horse man  
sees binocular sunset fields, gilded,  
not his oiled bridle.  

for aftercare, lice grow best  
in straight hair. make sure to iron your  
head and steam your crooked scalp.  
then unplug. no waves.
