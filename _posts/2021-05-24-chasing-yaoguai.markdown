Incense—sandalwood _and_ sage, just in case; a jade pendant on a red string, donut-shaped, for good fortune; fresh-picked plum blossom; four candles, rose-and-vanilla and vanilla-pumpkin-latte and chrysanthemum and apple-and-pear; a lighter, BIC; dustless glitter sidewalk chalk, 20 count; a Swiss army knife; three granola bars, fruit-and-nuts; a silk blanket, cream-and-red, woven by _Laolao_; a backpack, Kanken Sky Blue, to hold it all in.

That&#39;s all you need to summon a demon.

Ever since Em had turned fourteen and her parents had let her move into the basement bedroom—because she&#39;s a _high-schooler_ now, needs her own space—it was too freaking easy to sneak out. Prop up Mister Bumby next to the moon pillow next to the palm-sized desk fan, underneath the covers, for a moving, breathing, Em-shaped lump. Recite a quick quieting prayer with leftover honey and star anise, then slide open the cellar door. They&#39;d have no idea.

Besides, Em was a good kid. She wasn&#39;t the sneaking out type.

The world outside was silent. An early autumn chill bit through her windbreaker and both of the knitted layers underneath. Scattered yellow porchlights lit up the residential street like speckled stars—the stars themselves were tucked away behind clouds and residual smoke from wildfire season. When Em rolled her bicycle out from under the carport, the chain _click-click-squeaked_ against the pavement; it was asking for another cleaning. It rarely rained in Southern California, so Em left her bike outside all the time, but when it did, somehow the gears managed to rust at an unbelievable speed. Before she could swing a leg over the seat, though, sudden light from her phone screen gave her pause. A text from Sammie.

_Witching hour, witches!!!!_ it read. _LETS F\*\*\*IN GOOO!!!!!_

Em took a second to type out a reply, grinning into her jacket hood. The phone went back into her jeans pocket. Then, when she blinked into the darkness, nebulous shapes falling apart and puzzling back together as her eyes adjusted, in the corners of her vision a slender inky shape seemed to slink past the neighbor&#39;s silver Honda, almost like, like…

Her phone rumbled again. Alright, alright. She&#39;s coming.

Sammie was already waiting at the mouth of the neighborhood when Em rolled up. Though it wasn&#39;t like it was a hard task, getting from her apartment to Em&#39;s place—two streets were all that was needed to hold the entire residential population of their small town. They knocked handlebars when Em stopped. It only took one look for her to flinch under Sammie&#39;s curious gaze.

&quot;You good?&quot; Sammie asked. Somehow, she always knew.

&quot;Nothing. Just nervous.&quot;

&quot;All right. Too bad you didn&#39;t get caught sneaking out and got executed.&quot;

&quot;Too bad you didn&#39;t trip and impale yourself through the eye with a sharp rock.&quot;

&quot;Too bad you didn&#39;t puke up your entire stomach and die of food poisoning after dinner and then get eaten by rats and maggots and stuff.&quot;

&quot;Too bad you didn&#39;t flip your bike going down the hill and roll multiple times and crack open your skull like an egg. Like Hump-ey Dumpty, or something.&quot;

&quot;Like Humpty Dumpty?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Or something.&quot;

&quot;Too bad you didn&#39;t catch your leg in the bike chain and flay yourself alive and get grinded up like chicken nuggets. Ground up? Also, you sure this is a good idea? Didn&#39;t your grandma say demon summoning was like, what, super extra hella dangerous?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine. We&#39;re ready.&quot; Em said, and to prove it, she slung her backpack over her shoulder and started to pedal again. Sammie followed. The streetlights were brighter here, the closer they got to the center of town.

&quot;There&#39;s easier ways to get pizza around here, you know. We could make &#39;em at my place. You just have to make the flatbread, probs buy the sauce? It can&#39;t be that hard.&quot;

&quot;Nah. I want a Pizza Hut.&quot;

&quot;My nan has a great recipe. Stuffed crust dough and everything.&quot;

&quot;I really, _really_ want a Pizza Hut.&quot;

The endless rolling hills that comprised the terrain within city limits always did a number on Em&#39;s calves, so as they pedaled she let Sammie take the lead. _Up, down, up up, down down down_. The midnight quiet felt gossamer under their wheels. Slumbering cars hibernated on narrow two-lane streets, waiting on the sun to be awoken. Creeping powerlines hung low and crisscrossed the sky like spider webs. Hanging wooden signs swung back and forth over shop doors, letters illegible in the low light, making soft _schwip-schwiff_ sounds in the breeze. Em could hear it even over her panting breath. She was already sweating. Sammie was wearing a thick denim jacket, but she had her light blonde hair tied up in a ponytail, and Em would&#39;ve followed her lead if hers was long enough. Instead stringy pieces just stuck wetly to the back of her neck. Every time the wind blew by it was like a ghost breathing clammy against her nape.

&quot;I wonder what the demon&#39;s gonna ask for,&quot; Sammie wondered during a flat stretch, and without prompting slowed down so Em could catch up. She sucked in an inhale, grateful. &quot;Like, in exchange. Aren&#39;t they supposed to ask for your eternal soul, something like that?&quot;

&quot;I think Chinese demons are nicer.&quot;

&quot;Nicer? Really?&quot;

&quot;Well, they might be to me. Just maybe like, four thousand years of heavenly servitude, or something.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it could turn _you_ into a demon. That&#39;d be dope. You get summoned all over the world, see cool places, meet interesting people. Maybe kill them.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d have to acquire a taste for human meat.&quot;

&quot;You could put it on pizza.&quot;

&quot;White cheese, pepperoni and barbecue human. _Mmmm_.&quot;

Em had to slow down to contain her snickers, and Sammie dismounted too so they could walk the last bit of elevation. Here, this hill was the highest point in the entire town. Past Santa Clara Ave the houses had more verticality than width. On a clear day, you could stand in front of the church and stare two blocks down Salinas Street to Eden Boulevard where the burnt-down remains of the Ricketts house stood. Even under the pale moonlight it was obvious for its absence amongst the cramped, close-packed rows, like a knocked-out tooth waiting for a gold replacement. Or a Pizza Hut.

And then maybe it was just a trick of a flickering streetlight, but when Em glanced past the intersection of Santa Clara Ave and North Main St where the laundromat and taco joint formed a skinny alleyway, she could have sworn that a familiar black blur creeped out from past the steel trash cans, stretching out its fuzzy arched back just like, like…

&quot;_Hellooooo?_ Dude, what&#39;s up with you today?&quot; Sammie bumped her hip against Em&#39;s, who blinked first at nothing and then at the pavement in front of them.

&quot;Nothing. I&#39;m… it&#39;s fine. I just thought I saw... like a stray cat, or something.&quot;

&quot;What color?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;The cat. What color was it?&quot;

&quot;I dunno. Black, I guess.&quot;

&quot;Shit. Black cats are bad luck. That&#39;s not gonna mess things up, is it?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Em pulled her lips to the side, squinting at Sammie. &quot;No, they&#39;re not. In China, they&#39;re supposed to be lucky. In Japan, too. Lots of places.&quot;

&quot;Well, they aren&#39;t in California.&quot;

&quot;Kiki was a black cat, and she was nothing but good luck for me.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Sorry. I forgot.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine.&quot; Em released her bone-tight grip on her bike&#39;s handlebars. In the periphery of her vision, she could see the unsure hunch of Sammie&#39;s shoulders, the contriteness written there. She flexed her knuckles and breathed deep. _In, out_. &quot;Let&#39;s leave our bikes here. I don&#39;t wanna pedal it uphill behind your fat butt on the way back.&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Just like that, easygoing Sammie was grinning again, a little flicked-up arc of her upper lip. &quot;You want a piggy-back ride on the way down too, while we&#39;re at it?&quot;

&quot;Shut up.&quot;

&quot;What about a foot massage? A neck rub?&quot;

&quot;You can bike if you want. I&#39;m walking,&quot; Em said, and pushed at the kickstand until her bike stopped moving. Sammie let hers drop against the pavement, handlebars first, with a dull _clang_. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t do that. It&#39;s not good for the frame.&quot;

&quot;If it breaks, maybe Mom will buy me a nicer one.&quot;

&quot;Wow. Hustling your divorced single mom.&quot;

&quot;What can I say. I have no shame.&quot;

Bumping shoulders with Sammie helped to settle the void that was starting to gnaw at the contents of her stomach lining. The two of them loped down the steep hill, heavy backpacks bouncing against spines, the looming ruins growing in size as they approached. Here residential and commercial mixed incongruently; window mannequins and lawn gnomes alike watched with disapproving gazes as they snuck by. Em kept her eye out for any ghostly strays, but saw nothing.

The charred corpse of the former two-story Ricketts house stood a little way away from the rest of the sidewalk. Most of its wooden frame was still intact, giving it a distinctly skeletal feel, but blackened beams and scaffolding littered the ground floor among piles of gray ash. A red mailbox read _980_: the second house before the end of the street. Overgrown Bermuda grass contrasted sharply with new growth as they approached the property line. Em shivered. She stepped closer to Sammie.

&quot;This feels illegal.&quot;

&quot;I love it.&quot; Sammie said, and Em could hear the grin in her voice. &quot;What, you&#39;re not scared of demons, but you are of cops?&quot;

&quot;Maybe.&quot;

&quot;Come on. Let&#39;s do some crimes.&quot;

The moon was getting low. They had to hurry now, or they&#39;d miss the best parts of three AM. Spells were supposed to be strongest during witching hour, after all.

Sammie scampered left and right to look for an opening while Em dodged settled debris, carefully stepping over corroded plastics and metals and wishing she had long legs too. Once they were close to what seemed like the main frame, she paused to dig around in her backpack for the flashlight and turned it on. Shadows danced out of the way of the oncoming rays. Some of them seemed to make valiant attempts to re-form into sooty figures, but when Em turned her gaze onto them, they dissipated instantly like puffs of smoke.

With the flashlight, though, it was easier to pick out a path through the remnants of a doorway. The lack of a roof let moonlight filter in, illuminating the splintered floorboards. Em&#39;s tennis shoes picked up the dust and left ashy footprints behind.

&quot;Careful,&quot; Em hissed as Sammie booted away a piece of wreckage. The ruins of the house had been sitting here for years now, true, but that didn&#39;t mean an ill-placed kick couldn&#39;t make the whole thing come crashing down.

&quot;Relax. How much space do we need?&quot;

&quot;Enough to sit down in.&quot;

Little pockets of grass were growing out from between half-rotted wooden beams. Even though Em was holding the flashlight, Sammie took the lead as they navigated deeper into the house. It wasn&#39;t the first time they&#39;d snuck around—it was every teen&#39;s favorite local haunt—but it was their first time doing so in the dead of night. Sometimes, when Em was feeling extra witchy and could entice Kiki out of the neighborhood with tinned tuna, they&#39;d sneak around back. The shadows shifted. Out of the corner of her eye, dark silhouettes curled against the walls just like, like…

Em shook her head. This house was getting to her.

There wasn&#39;t much to the original story. It was about as mundane, albeit sad, as they come. When Sammie had just moved to town two years ago, Em must&#39;ve repeated it on at least forty-three separate occasions. She refused to tell it again. Forty-four was extra, double, _yaoguai_-inviting bad luck.Ricketts, who was an alcoholic by day and absentee father figure by night, caught his wife swapping spit with a bespectacled librarian and burnt their house down in the dead of night. Sleeping kids and wife and himself still in it. And that was that—at least, that&#39;s what they said. But either way nobody would buy the old lot—who would, with all that bad _qi_?—so abandoned it stayed.

Still, when _Laolao_ whispered about the inauspicious energy that seemed to emanate from that house, and after those slews of mysterious out-of-town investors pulled out at the last second as always, sometimes Em still wondered. It felt like they were chasing ghosts, the shadowy memories of the family that once lived here just out of fingertip reach.

They had to circle back a few times to bypass blocked passages and cramped, collapsed rooms. An unexplored pathway caught Em&#39;s eye; she lurched on her heels and tugged at Sammie&#39;s elbow.

&quot;We haven&#39;t checked there yet.&quot;

&quot;Hmm.&quot; Sammie followed the direction of her pointing finger and examined the half-fallen doorframe. A large brass pipe blocked the way. Gingerly, Sammie tested it with her foot, then grabbed the top and hauled herself up. &quot;Need a hand?&quot;

&quot;I got it,&quot; Em said, then struggled for a minute before taking Sammie&#39;s palm.

Behind the pipe was a small clearing that looked like the remains of a great room. A few still-intact arched windowpanes gave the impression of former height, and the floor tiles were in surprisingly good condition. A caved-in fireplace left bricks strewn everywhere. Though still cold, the air felt warmer here—trapped, stagnant, like the belly of some serpentine dragon. Em dropped her backpack onto the ground. It unseated the top layer of dust, making her cough.

Sammie was already unpacking. &quot;I brought fruit snacks.&quot;

&quot;Fruit snacks?&quot;

&quot;Welch and stuff. Some Hi-Chew.&quot;

&quot;I would not describe Hi-Chew as a fruit snack.&quot;

&quot;You want some Gatorade? I brought cups.&quot;

&quot;No. Saving room for pizza. Who drinks Gatorade from cups?&quot;

&quot;Nah, dude. The cups are for like, if the demon has horns. We could put &#39;em on our heads and stuff to make it think we&#39;re just like them. See?&quot;

&quot;You just look like a human with red solo cups on her head. A dumb one.&quot;

&quot;Whatever. It&#39;s polite. Respectful.&quot;

Em unpacked her carefully-folded blanket and spread it out across the cold and chalky floor. Sorry, _Laolao_. They might be waiting for a while. Then she extracted the candles and laid them out in a circle. Well, a circle with four corners. So… a square.

&quot;Should we draw something on the floor?&quot; Sammie had the chalk. &quot;Like, a pentagram or something?&quot;

&quot;Kinda cliché. A circle?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yeah. I know just the thing.&quot;

Carefully, with the white chalk, Sammie drew a wide circle just around the four candles. Then, while Em dug around in her backpack for the lighter, Sammie sectioned off half of the circle to shape and color in a white swirl. She left unfilled a circle in the middle of the thick part of the white, then drew a matching circle in the empty black swirl.

&quot;Dude.&quot; Em blinked at it, lighter in hand. &quot;You&#39;re freaking kidding me.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a yin yang, right?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t tell if this is offensive or not.&quot;

&quot;Oh, fuck. Is it?&quot;

&quot;Whatever. It doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Em lit the candles, one by one. The smells of rose-and-vanilla and vanilla-pumpkin-latte and chrysanthemum and apple-and-pear blended together, discordant and sickly sweet. &quot;It&#39;s all about the chant, anyway. And the incense.&quot;

&quot;It smells like a Starbucks in here.&quot;

&quot;Sorry. Bath and Bodyworks didn&#39;t have human flesh or blood-and-entrails.&quot;

&quot;Eh, it&#39;s fine. Maybe the demon will like sweets. What&#39;s the chant?&quot;

&quot;_Yaomo guiguai kuai jinlai_,&quot; Em emphasized each syllable. &quot;_Yaomo guiguai kuai jinlai_.&quot;

&quot;Yow-moe gway…&quot;

&quot;_Yaomo guiguai._&quot;

&quot;_Yaomo_ gwaykw-ai...&quot;

&quot;_Guiguai_.&quot; Em lit the incense and let it sit in the clay holder, next to the plum blossom branch. Notes of wood and spice added to the mix—the overlapping scents were starting to make her head spin.

&quot;_Yaomo guiguai… guai jinlai_? _Yaomo guiguai kuai jinlai._&quot;

&quot;Close enough.&quot;

&quot;Cool. _Yaomo guiguai kuai jinlai_. _Yaomo guiguai kuai jinlai_. What does it mean?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just an invitation for demons and evil spirits. Like, asking them to come in. Okay, ready.&quot;

The two of them scrambled to either side of the circle. Em took the _yin_ side. Sammie took the _yang_. It felt like they should be holding hands or something, only Em was too knotted up inside to ask, but as always Sammie seemed to know exactly what she was thinking and offered her palms. They were so warm. Deep breaths, Em. _In, out. In, out._

&quot;_Yaomo guiguai kuai jinlai_,&quot;

They chanted together in unison.

&quot;_Yaomo guiguai kuai jinlai_,&quot;

A night wind picked up. It whistled through shattered windows: _fshhh, shhhh._

&quot;_Yaomo guiguai kuai jinlai_,&quot;

The shaky ruins of the house swayed and creaked around them.

&quot;_Yaomo guiguai kuai jinlai_!&quot;

Then… nothing.

Every witch was born knowing how to read _qi_. That&#39;s what _Laolao_ always said—it was how you knew you were a witch. Though she didn&#39;t get many opportunities, Em knew, too. But the cold, stale air in the room felt the same. If the energy had changed, she couldn&#39;t tell. Em cracked open a cautious eyelid and saw Sammie staring back at her.

&quot;Did it work?&quot;

Em chewed on her lower lip. &quot;Maybe we need to be clearer about the deal.&quot;

&quot;Oh, gotcha.&quot; Sammie swiveled her head back and forth to glance around the room, but didn&#39;t let go of Em&#39;s hands. &quot;Demons, you up?&quot;

Faintly, Em could feel something fuzzy at the edges of her temples, but when she tried to focus on the feeling it fizzled out again. She swallowed and gathered her voice. &quot;Demons, if you&#39;re there, we&#39;re here to make you a deal!&quot;

If it was cold before, the sudden chill that infiltrated the circle cut straight to bone.

&quot;We offer you our heavenly souls in eternal bondage!&quot;

The fuzzy feeling was back again. Em willed herself to ignore it.

&quot;In exchange, we ask for a Pizza Hut!&quot;

And everything went black.

It was like all of the light—candlelight, moonlight, flashlight—had been sucked out of the room at once. Distantly she could hear Sammie cursing under her breath. Without the benefit of her vision, Em fluttered her useless eyes closed and reached out with her own _qi_, probing the void for any sign of… of something. Anything. She felt like she could float away in the feeling, lost in this unattached emptiness, but the rough calluses of Sammie&#39;s fingertips that clenched so tightly to her knuckles kept her feet on the ground. The darkness was forming, growing, shaping, carving, spreading, mutating. Em could feel each spectral outline. A two-headed boar, a _qilin_, a writhing snake, a guardian lion, an elderly man, an old crone, a beautiful princess. Each form felt blurry, uncertain at the edges, like shadow puppets dancing behind a curtain.

Then, during one of its last undulating transitions, the shadows seem to draw together. This shape felt the most solid, the most familiar. Em knew it instantly. A small, fluid body with an arched spine and long, silky tail. Four graceful legs and four mischievous paws. Delicate whiskers and alert ears. If she could get closer she knew there would be two amber eyes, full of intelligence, of affection.

Em&#39;s eyes flew open. &quot;Kiki—?&quot;

But it wasn&#39;t Kiki. Instead, floating over their chalk circle, the ghostly figure of a beautiful woman stared down at them. Even in the warm candlelight she ran bluish-gray. Her expression looked unimpressed, or maybe it was her prominent cheekbones, the slant of her thin lips. Long, straight black hair cascaded down to her shoulders, almost to her waist. She was clad in white—in death.

_THAT IS NOT MY NAME._ The spirit said, but it was more like a feeling of something having been said, a new memory tucked away that had already happened, had always happened. When Em tried, she couldn&#39;t recall the voice.

But something felt wrong. When Em reached out with her _qi_, she could see the demon for what she really was: a skeletal spirit, with the same high cheekbones and slender wrists. It was like watching her through two lenses with different prescriptions, double images overlaid into one. She shivered. Her pounding heartbeat echoed in the empty room.

&quot;Jesus,&quot; said Sammie, by her side, and then suddenly Em wasn&#39;t as afraid anymore. She squeezed Em&#39;s hand tighter; her heartbeat stuttered against Em&#39;s wrist. &quot;Are you seeing this?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Okay. Cool. Cool cool cool. This is cool.&quot;

Then… a distant memory tugged at the back of her mind, something that felt like after-school cartoons and sliced fruit. Em squinted. Curiosity overtook terror. &quot;Are you…?&quot;

_YOU MAY CALL ME BAIGUJING._

&quot;What does that mean?&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t have a meaning, it&#39;s just a name. Does _Sammie_ have a meaning?&quot;

&quot;Well, I was just asking.&quot;

_IT IS ALL RIGHT, CHILD. IT MEANS WHITE BONE SPIRIT._

&quot;Oh. See?&quot;

&quot;Whatever.&quot;

_ANYWAY, I AM NOT TAKING YOUR DEAL._

&quot;What? Why?&quot; Em stepped backward, forcing Sammie back too. Were they going to have to make a run for it?

_BECAUSE I DO NOT NEED MORE DISCIPLES, THAT IS WHY! I HEARD YOUR CALL AND THOUGHT IT WAS FINALLY MY CHANCE FOR A MEAL, BUT THEN I SAW YOUR, Baigujing_ motioned to her neckline. Em&#39;s fingers flew to the jade pendant at her chest, the cooling, soothing, smooth surface of it. Yet another gift from _Laolao_; she never took it off. _AND I KNEW, OH, GREAT, HERE IS ANOTHER TRAINEE WITCH WANTING TO STUDY THE SECRETS OF FORM-TAKING AND BLIGHT-BRINGING AND DEATH-DEFYING AND ETCETERA. SO, NO. I HAVE ENOUGH GIRLS TO TAKE CARE OF AS IS. _

She tapped her chin with a bony finger. _I WILL TAKE SOME FLESH, THOUGH._

&quot;Excuse me, what the fuck?&quot;

&quot;_Sammie!_&quot;

_I AM HUNGRY. CHILDREN LIKE YOU ARE SO SWEET. JUST A SLIVER FROM THE THIGH OR ARM? AFTER ALL, YOU&#39;VE MADE ME COME ALL THIS WAY._

&quot;Umm.&quot; Sammie let go of her hand. Em wanted to shrink back, or scram, or scream, or all of the above. Instead she watched as Sammie picked up her discarded backpack and started digging. &quot;Do you… want some Hi-Chew?&quot;

Now it was the spirit&#39;s turn to look confused. _WHAT?_

&quot;Hi-Chew,&quot; Em said, slow grin forming. &quot;It&#39;ll be sweeter than us, promise.&quot;

Sammie tossed a wrapped candy. Predictably, it sailed right through her and landed with a clatter, skidding across the floor. &quot;Shit, sorry. I got it.&quot;

_I WAS NOT READY. AGAIN._

_Baigujing_&#39;s incorporeal form shimmered again, then seemed to solidify and grow opaque. When Sammie finished unwrapping the piece and dropped it into her palms, she brought it to her mouth, pearly teeth chomping down.

&quot;Do you like it?&quot; Em asked.

It was interesting to watch a skeleton think. There were no muscles to tug at skin she didn&#39;t have, but her cheekbones scrunched up and her lower jaw rattled to the side. When she nodded, each individual vertebra knocked together like a wind chime. _Clink. Clink._

..._YES.__Clink. Clink. MORE!_

&quot;You can have the whole bag.&quot; Sammie tossed it to her.

_ALL RIGHT, FINE. I ACCEPT YOUR DEAL. NOW WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANTED?_

&quot;A Pizza Hut.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, a Pizza Hut. Here in town. Please.&quot;

_HM? OH, NO. I CANNOT DO THAT._

&quot;…What?&quot;

_SORRY. I AM AN ANCIENT FLESH-EATING CHINESE DEMON, NOT THE BOARD DIRECTOR OF GROWTH AND EXPANSION OF THE AMERICAN FAST FOOD CORPORATION YUM BRANDS INC._

Panic seized every square inch of Em&#39;s nerves. It lit a fire in her veins that had her surging forward, drawing together every inch of her five-foot frame to face the demon eye-to-eye socket. Her knuckles clenched and unclenched and clenched again. &quot;You have to! You accepted our offering! I need—we need this—we already came all this way!&quot;

_NOPE. CANNOT DO IT._

&quot;You—&quot;

&quot;Hey, hey, it&#39;s okay,&quot; Sammie was right back at her side. &quot;It&#39;s fine, okay? We can make pizza at home, it&#39;s not a big deal, right?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not—it&#39;s not about the _freaking_ pizza!&quot;

_OH?_ Em wished immediately that she could cut out her own tongue. The ghostly specter seemed to float closer; she could feel _Baigujing_&#39;s frosted breath against her cheeks. If Em leaned forward just an inch, they&#39;d be knocking skulls. _WHAT IS IT ABOUT, THEN? TELL ME._

&quot;It&#39;s—nothing. I just… I really like Pizza Hut!&quot;

_WHO IS KIKI, CHILD?_

Then it was like she was possessed, or like the demon had put her under some sort of spell, only she knew that couldn&#39;t be it because of the jade at her chest that protected her from bewitchment. Maybe it was just that the words had finally found a place to go.

&quot;Kiki was my—cat. She was my cat and my… familiar. I found her as a stray kitten and I raised her and she was the _best_ companion, okay? The best. The most diligent assistant, the most lover—loving and loyalest soul. She had the cutest little paws and sweetest nose and her whiskers, her whiskers were so fluffy and twitchy and, and—and four months ago, she…&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Sammie reached for her fingers again. Her voice was hushed; somber, with unexpected delicacy. &quot;It was an accident.&quot;

&quot;No, it… I was really… I was being such a _baby_ that night, okay? It was late, but I _really_ wanted pizza, and I begged Dad to go, but… the closest pizza place is…&quot;

&quot;…An hour away in San Bernardino.&quot;

Em swallowed. &quot;By the time he got back, it was so dark, and—and Kiki&#39;s all black and her eyesight isn&#39;t too good &#39;cause genetically, and—&quot;

&quot;Shit, Em. It wasn&#39;t your fault, you know that, right?&quot;

&quot;I know it wasn&#39;t.&quot; Her throat felt so dry. &quot;It was Pizza Hut&#39;s fault, okay? For not having a branch here. If they took over this lot and built over it and we could get pizza in twenty minutes instead of two hours, then maybe, maybe…&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot; Em could hear the cracks, the cobweb-slivers spreading through Sammie&#39;s voice. &quot;You only said… I didn&#39;t know…&quot;

&quot;What would be the point?&quot;

&quot;I could&#39;ve… Em, I could&#39;ve been there.&quot;

Em wrenched her hand away and fell to her knees. Sharp pebbles cut at her shins through the silk, but the sensation barely registered. It was like all the feelings that had been shoveled away, pushed down, buried deep, were all bubbling and frothing at the surface again. The loss felt suddenly sharp, fresh, new all over again. The stitches that she had so carefully put together over the past few months were torn apart. All the stuffing inside was spilling out.

When _Baigujing_ spoke again, it was with such profound sadness and finality. _I CANNOT BRING HER BACK. PIZZA HUT CANNOT, EITHER. NO MAGIC CAN. BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT, MISS WITCH. _

The spirit floated closer and peered down at her. The spectral wind that seemed to follow her wherever she went chilled the drying tear-tracks on Em&#39;s cheeks. Distantly she saw Sammie step forward, protective.

_BUT MAYBE THIS WILL HELP, YES?_

And there it was again: all the light exhaled out of the room in an instant. But this time the amorphous shape that bubbled and rippled seemed to have a purpose to it. It shrank and shrank, and grew thick black fur and four legs and… and…

In a hoarse whisper: &quot;Kiki?&quot;

This time, it was Kiki. It was really her. It had to be. Those round, inquisitive amber eyes _knew_ her. When the cat stalked forward, form as jet-black and solid as the last time Em remembered, she had the same kink in her tail, the same lifelong limp she&#39;d acquired from starting a fight with the neighbor&#39;s German Shepherd as a kitten.

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Sammie said. &quot;It&#39;s nice to see you again.&quot;

Em offered her palm. Kiki sniffed at it, her warm, wet nose bringing back aching memories. When Em rubbed behind her ear, it was soft.

She _knew_ it was just the demon&#39;s magic. A trick of the mind. But then Kiki curled up into her waiting lap—her favorite spot—and Sammie sat down next to her, back-to-back, and Em couldn&#39;t bring herself to care. The candles were burning low. The incense had long faded to just a whiff of resin. And all of the anger had seeped out. After her outburst, it felt like everything inside had been sucked out just like the light, leaving her empty. Exhaustion, a reminder that neither of them had slept at all that night, settled into her bones. Em tilted her head back. Sammie&#39;s shoulder was warm. It was solid and real.

&quot;You alive?&quot;

&quot;Not going anywhere, Em.&quot;

The pain that had shocked her with its sudden intensity subsided to a dull ache. But it didn&#39;t feel so bad anymore. It was a growing sort of pain. Slowly, anchored by the sturdy feel of Sammie&#39;s shoulder, and covered by the band-aid of _Baigujing_&#39;s illusory magic, Em started to sew herself back together again underneath. Inhale, exhale. _In, out. In, out._

She wasn&#39;t sure how long they sat there in the dark, but soon enough morning rays began to stream in, illuminating Sammie&#39;s freckled face in bright stripes. The sun was coming up. Early dawnlight filtered in through the patchwork roof, washing them in hues of golds and pinks and purples. Fallen leaves, already browning, blew in through gaps in the ruined house&#39;s skeleton. Warblers and wrens were singing outside: _new day, new morning, new, new, new_. When the first sunbeams reached Em&#39;s lap, and the silhouette in her arms started to shimmer and glow and dissipate, she chased the _yaoguai_ with her _qi_. To keep it close for as long as she could.

&quot;Well.&quot;

As always, Sammie brought her back to earth.

&quot;Morning.&quot;

&quot;Morning. I can&#39;t believe we did that.&quot;

Even as the demon&#39;s shadowy _qi_ slipped through her fingers, she held on.

Then the solidity at her back disappeared suddenly as Sammie stood up, stretched out her back, stuck out a hand. Sammie was grinning. Em didn&#39;t even have to look. The promise of warmth was offered to her again, if she wanted it. &quot;Still want that piggyback ride?&quot;

Em blinked. Then she laughed.

&quot;A neck rub would be nice,&quot; she said, and to take Sammie&#39;s hand, she let go.
